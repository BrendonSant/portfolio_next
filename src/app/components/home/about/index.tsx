                    <p>
                    I'm a Computer Engineering student, nerd and passionate about art. <br />
                    I started my adventure in the world of digital arts in 2017 after completing <br />
                    my course at Npix. Since then, I've dedicated myself to improving my work, <br />
                    always looking for opportunities to learn more and show what I know.</p>
